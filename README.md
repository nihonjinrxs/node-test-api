# node-test-api

This is a dummy API I use to test infrastructurey things like monitoring and system health checks.

It has 3 get endpoints:

* `/` - responds with a 200 response and `I'm alive!`
* `/beacon` - responds with a 200 response and `OK`
* `/ping` - responds with a 200 response and `pong`

Use this as you like, but I'm not maintaining this except for my own use.
